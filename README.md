# store

store is a transactional key-value database designed to support oltp workloads within a larger distributed system.

for now, store is a single node system, but the plan is to scale it out into a distributed system, with an eventual positioning similar to [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv).

development is ongoing (you can't use it yet), but if you want to learn more about architecture/implementation details, or follow along the development process, you can read more at [my blog](https://checkersnotchess.dev).
